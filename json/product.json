        "description": "**Private Project & Informations**\n\nYou can read the ingredients of our products here. We guarantee a refund if you get banned. Sure, there are a few stores that can guarantee a refund if it's banned or doesn't work. This explains everything.\n\n**__Product safety__:**\n- We use our personal source that we update it all the time. For almost everything we have a development team for updates. So you can rest assured that we have after-sales service and help you at all times. So if you encounter any problems or problems. You can contact the support team.\n\n**__Kernel driver__:**\n- We use secure drivers and are bypassed by an AI supported by a website. That's why it's almost 100% safe because the Driver can detect memory leaks and create two identical files. To lie to the guard that it was already working, hmm, quite difficult to explain. Let's just say it's safe enough.\n\n**__Reverse engineering__:**\n- We have Anti-Cracks, that's why it has Loader to provide a second layer of protection to keep Source from leaking out, including and if anyone tries to cracks or does something. We will be able to know immediately.\n\n**__External & Internal__:**\n- As we told you this is a personal project. So you can choose whether you want external or intenal, but if you choose which one is more secure. I recommend it as an external is better.\n\n**__Bypass__:** \nBefore you start using your project, it will take 1-2 minutes to activate. Because it has to bypass and spoof information such as IP , HWID , S.N and number information. to protect the 3rd layer\n\n\n<a:1040617366721146880:1071018206803795998> **And** there are others as well But we cannot disclose information. Because it is our company secret. If we disclose all information There may be imitations of our products , Other question DM <@1031767513077387284>",
